# PokeSearch

## Objective
- This aplication provides basic information about all kwown pokemon using the PokemonAPI.
- It is my first react project, suggested by DevEmDobro to hone my skills with React.

## What can you check
- You can check all registered pokemon in groups of 10.
- There is a restrictive accumulative filter by type, so you can locate the desired pokemon
- Each pokemon can be clicked to check types, possible moves and abilities. This last one includes the description.
- If you wish to return to the main list, you can click on the Pokeball or on the title, your filters and number of shown pokemon are stored.
- Dark theme is set on default, you can change it freely. 

## Tools used
- This project was created using Vanilla JavaScript, React and Vite.
- It includes some libraries, such as:
  - Styled Components to avoid several css files, inlining styles and enjoy multiple aplications possible by JS styling.
  - ContextAPI to provide themes to several components.
  - react-router-dom to route between pages without realoading, providing a Single Page Aplication (SPA).
  - Axios library for API requests, improving security.
